/**
 * Access-control coherence between this dashboard and the API.
 *
 * `allowed_sections` is keyed by the backend's own section identifiers
 * (`SECTION_PERMISSIONS` in `apps/admin_dashboard/services.py`). A nav item
 * naming a key that does not exist there resolves to `undefined`, which is
 * falsy, so the item silently disappears for every non-superuser admin —
 * which is exactly what happened to education (`subjects`), study plans
 * (`study_plans` vs `study`) and audit logs (`audit` vs `audit_logs`).
 *
 * Hiding a nav item is never the security mechanism: the backend denies the
 * endpoint independently. This guards the *coherence* of the two.
